Here’s a polished and more detailed rewrite of your message so your team can clearly understand and execute each point effectively:

---

### 🔧 Website Update Instructions

#### 1. **Contact Form Placement**

* Add the **same contact form** (currently used elsewhere on the site) **right before the footer** on all relevant pages.
* Ensure the design is consistent and responsive across all devices.

#### 2. **Chat Icon**

* Add a **floating chat icon** on the **bottom left corner** of every page.
* It should remain **visible while scrolling** and not overlap with other floating elements.

#### 3. **Influencer Collaborations Section**

* Expand this section by **adding more influencer videos** (preferably in a grid or carousel layout).
* Include **different types of UGC content** such as:

  * Shoutouts
  * Unboxings
  * Reviews
  * Tryouts
* Make it **visually engaging** and **scroll-interactive**, reflecting a **social media or celebrity vibe**.

#### 4. **Service Pages Enhancement**

* Add **interactive elements** to each service page — e.g. short animated icons, hover effects, video snippets, or before/after visuals.
* The goal is to make each service **feel alive and immersive**, not just static text.

#### 5. **Client Reviews Section**

* Change the **star color** in the “What Our Clients Say” section to **golden yellow**.
* **Remove** the button labeled “Read More Reviews on Trustpilot.”
* Ensure spacing and typography look balanced after the removal.

#### 6. **Case Study Redirect Behavior**

* When users click **“Read Full Case Study”**, ensure:

  * It redirects to the **Case Study page** and starts from the **top of the page**, not the bottom.
  * Apply this logic across all internal redirects — every page should open from the **top** for smooth user experience.

#### 7. **UGC Campaign Main Page**

* Create a **dedicated page** titled **“View Full UGC Campaign.”**
* Design it with:

  * **Exciting visuals and animations** inspired by social media.
  * **Short videos and highlights** (shoutouts, unboxings, tryouts, influencer reels).
  * A **celebrity-style layout** that makes it feel authentic and dynamic.
  * Include a **mix of physical and digital brand collaborations.**

#### 8. **Portfolio Section**

* Rework the **Our Portfolio** section to be **more informative and story-driven.**
* Follow a **case study approach** — show:

  * The **brand’s starting point**,
  * The **strategy and process**,
  * The **transformation results** (visuals, metrics, impact).
* Goal: let visitors understand **how we take brands from ground to sky**.

#### 9. **Footer Redesign**

* Redesign the **footer** to be **sleek, modern, and minimalistic.**
* Use clean typography, proper spacing, and subtle background contrast.
* Remove any outdated or cluttered elements.

Would you like me to turn this into a **formatted task document** (e.g., a “Website Update Brief” PDF or Google Doc-style layout) that you can send to your web dev/design team?
