🔧 Homepage & Projects Section Revamp Instructions
1. Featured Projects → Success Stories

Replace the current “Featured Projects” section with a new “Our Success Stories” section.

Goal:
Showcase each project as a story of success — from planning and strategy to execution and results — giving visitors a quick overview of the journey behind every project.

Structure:

Each project card should summarize the journey in a “snapshot” format (a brief intro, objective, process, and outcome).

Include visuals like before/after shots, key metrics, and short text highlights.

When a visitor clicks on a project, they’ll be taken to an individual project page that contains:

Full case study with detailed timelines and visuals.

Challenges faced and solutions implemented.

Client feedback or testimonial.

I’ve attached a document with our actual success stories — please review it carefully to understand the tone, structure, and level of detail we want to display.

2. Trustpilot Reviews / Testimonials

Add a new Trustpilot Reviews or What Our Clients Say section to the homepage.

Goal:
Show real feedback and testimonials from our verified Trustpilot account to build authenticity and trust.

Design Suggestions:

Display 3–5 rotating reviews with the star rating, client name, and company (if available).

Include a “Read More Reviews” button that links directly to our Trustpilot profile.

Use interactive motion (e.g., fade/slide animations) to make the section engaging.

3. UGC (User-Generated Content) Showcase

Add a creative and interactive section dedicated to Social Media Marketing / Influencer Collaborations.

Goal:
Highlight our collaborations with influencers and the UGC videos they’ve created for our campaigns.

Design & Functionality:

Create a visually rich, dynamic grid or carousel showing short looping video clips (TikTok, Instagram Reels style).

Each video card should autoplay on hover/tap, with a title overlay (e.g., “UGC by @username”).

Include a “View More UGCs” or “See Full Campaign” button leading to a dedicated UGC page.

Optionally add filters/tabs like Fashion, Tech, Sports, Beauty to categorize UGC campaigns.

4. Additional Homepage Enhancements (Optional but Recommended)

Add a “Stats & Achievements” section highlighting milestones (e.g., “50+ successful projects”, “10M+ ad impressions”, “5-Star rating on Trustpilot”).

Include a “Why Brands Choose Us” section summarizing your agency’s key strengths (e.g., data-driven approach, AI-integrated marketing, influencer partnerships).

Integrate subtle micro-animations (scroll effects, hover transitions) to keep the site interactive and modern.
