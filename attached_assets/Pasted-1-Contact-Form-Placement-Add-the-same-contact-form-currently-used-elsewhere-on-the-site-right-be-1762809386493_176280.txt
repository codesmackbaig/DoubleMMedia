1. Contact Form Placement

Add the same contact form (currently used elsewhere on the site) right before the footer on all relevant pages.

Ensure the design is consistent and responsive across all devices.

2. Chat Icon

Add a floating chat icon on the bottom left corner of every page.

It should remain visible while scrolling and not overlap with other floating elements.

3. Influencer Collaborations Section

Expand this section by adding more influencer videos (preferably in a grid or carousel layout).

Include different types of UGC content such as:

Shoutouts

Unboxings

Reviews

Tryouts

Make it visually engaging and scroll-interactive, reflecting a social media or celebrity vibe.

4. Service Pages Enhancement

Add interactive elements to each service page — e.g. short animated icons, hover effects, video snippets, or before/after visuals.

The goal is to make each service feel alive and immersive, not just static text.

5. Client Reviews Section

Change the star color in the “What Our Clients Say” section to golden yellow.

Remove the button labeled “Read More Reviews on Trustpilot.”

Ensure spacing and typography look balanced after the removal.

6. Case Study Redirect Behavior

When users click “Read Full Case Study”, ensure:

It redirects to the Case Study page and starts from the top of the page, not the bottom.

Apply this logic across all internal redirects — every page should open from the top for smooth user experience.

7. UGC Campaign Main Page

Create a dedicated page titled “View Full UGC Campaign.”

Design it with:

Exciting visuals and animations inspired by social media.

Short videos and highlights (shoutouts, unboxings, tryouts, influencer reels).

A celebrity-style layout that makes it feel authentic and dynamic.

Include a mix of physical and digital brand collaborations.

8. Portfolio Section

Rework the Our Portfolio section to be more informative and story-driven.

Follow a case study approach — show:

The brand’s starting point,

The strategy and process,

The transformation results (visuals, metrics, impact).

Goal: let visitors understand how we take brands from ground to sky.

9. Footer Redesign

Redesign the footer to be sleek, modern, and minimalistic.

Use clean typography, proper spacing, and subtle background contrast.

Remove any outdated or cluttered elements.
