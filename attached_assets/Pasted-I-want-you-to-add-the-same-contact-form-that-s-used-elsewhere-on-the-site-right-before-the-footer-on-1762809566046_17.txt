I want you to add the same contact form that’s used elsewhere on the site right before the footer on every relevant page. It should be cleanly integrated into the layout, ensuring consistent styling, spacing, and responsiveness across all devices. Right above the footer, it should act as a final call-to-action for visitors to get in touch, maintaining our brand colors and button styles. Additionally, I’d like a floating chat icon added to the bottom left corner of every page. This chat icon should stay visible as users scroll, without overlapping with any other floating elements or disrupting the mobile view. It should feel intuitive, modern, and accessible to visitors at all times.

In the Influencer Collaborations section, please expand the content by adding more videos and variety. Include influencer shoutouts, unboxings, reviews, tryouts, and lifestyle clips — all related to both physical and digital e-commerce brands. The section should feel more interactive and visually dynamic, like a social media reel gallery that brings our collaborations to life. Use creative layouts such as sliders, hover video previews, or carousel grids to keep users engaged. Similarly, each service page on the website should include interactive elements that make the experience more immersive — short animations, before-and-after visuals, dynamic icons, or embedded micro videos that showcase results and highlight our creative process. This will help transform static pages into engaging, story-driven sections that truly reflect our energy and capability.

In the What Our Clients Say section, change the color of the stars to a golden yellow to make them stand out and appear more premium and celebratory. Also, remove the “Read More Reviews on Trustpilot” button completely — it’s not adding much value and visually clutters the section. When a visitor clicks on “Read Full Case Study”, make sure the redirection always lands at the top of the Case Study page instead of the bottom, so that visitors can start reading the story from the beginning. Apply the same redirection logic throughout the site — any link that opens a new page should always load from the top for a smoother and more intuitive user experience.

I also want you to create a dedicated page for our UGC Campaigns, titled “View Full UGC Campaign.” This page should feel exciting, modern, and full of movement — think celebrity-style, influencer-driven, and social media-inspired design. Include creative visuals, highlight videos, and various forms of content like shoutouts, unboxings, reviews, and product tryouts. The layout should blend lifestyle and commerce — a mix of digital brand collabs and real-world products — to help visitors instantly connect with the energy of UGC marketing.

Next, revamp the Our Portfolio section to make it more informative, inspiring, and case-study oriented. Each portfolio item should tell a story — where the brand started, what challenges they faced, how our team strategized and executed the transformation, and what measurable results we achieved. Present it in a way that helps readers understand how we take brands from ground to sky, showing visuals, data points, and transformation highlights that build credibility and trust.

Lastly, I want the footer completely redesigned. I don’t like the current layout — it feels outdated and cluttered. Redesign it to be modern, sleek, and minimalistic, with a clean grid, balanced typography, subtle color tones, and clear structure. Keep it simple yet elegant, making sure it reflects the professional and creative aesthetic of our brand.
